// @todo

// Implement the missing cases of the encode function. Encode booleans as t and nil,
// floating-point numbers using Goâ€™s notation, and complex numbers like 1+2i as #C
// (1.02.0). Interfaces can be encoded as a pair of a type name and a value, for
// instance ("[]int"(123)), but beware that this notation is ambiguous:
// the reflect.Type.String method may return the same string for different types.
