// Implement a concurrent File Transfer Protocol (FTP) server. Ther server should
// interpret commands from each client such as cd to change directory, ls to list a
// directory, get to send the contents of a file, and close to close the connection.
// You can use the standard ftp command as the client, or write your own.
