// @todo

// Failure of any client program to read data in a timely manner ultimately causes
// all clients to get stuck. Modify the broadcaster to skip a message rather than
// wait if a client writer is not ready to accept it. Alternatively, add buffering
// to each clientâ€™s outgoing message channel so that most messages are not dropped;
// the broadcaster should use a non-blocking send to this channel.
