// The import "C" declaration is special. There is no package C, but this import
// causes go build to preprocess the file using the cgo tool before the Go compiler
// sees it.
//
// During preprocessing, cgo generates a temporary package that contains Go
// declarations cor- responding to all the C functions and types used by the file,
// such as C.bz_stream and C.BZ2_bzCompressInit. The cgo tool discovers these types
// by invoking the C compiler in a special way on the contents of the comment that
// precedes the import declaration.
//
// The comment may also contain #cgo directives that specify extra options to the C
// toolchain. The CFLAGS and LDFLAGS values contribute extra arguments to the
// compiler and linker com- mands so that they can locate the bzlib.h header file
// and the libbz2.a archive library. The example assumes that these are installed
// beneath /usr on your system. You may need to alter or delete these flags for your
// installation.
