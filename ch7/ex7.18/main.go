// Using the token-based decoder API, write a program that will readd an arbitrary
// XML document and construct a tree of generic nodes that represents it. Nodes are
// of two kinds: CharData nodes represent text strings, and Element nodes represent
// named elements and their attributes. Each element node has a slice of child
// nodes.
