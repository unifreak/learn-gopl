// (*IntSet).UnionWith computes the union of two sets using |, the word-parallel
// bitwise OR operator. Implement methods for IntersetctWith, DifferenceWith, and
// SymetricDifference for the corresponding set operation. (The symmetric difference
// of two sets contains the elements present in one set or the other but not both.)
